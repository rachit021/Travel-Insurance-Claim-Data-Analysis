### Goals 
The goal of this project is to determine if we can predict the claim status (Yes or No) from the various travel insurance-related attributes.

### Dataset 
The dataset has 63326 records. There are 11 fields/attributes where "Claim" is the target variable.

### Results
More focus of the project was on EDA rather than Model Building.
Since the Dataset was highly imbalanced dataset we have tried oversampling,undersampling,SMOTE to deal with it .
