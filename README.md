### Goals 
The goal of this project is to determine if we can predict the claim status (Yes or No) from the various travel insurance-related attributes.

### Dataset 
The dataset has 63326 records. There are 11 fields/attributes where "Claim" is the target variable.
Target:  • Claim Status (Claim.Status) 
         • Name of agency (Agency) 
         • Type of travel insurance agencies (Agency.Type) 
         • Distribution channel of travel insurance agencies (Distribution.Channel) 
         • Name of the travel insurance products (Product.Name) 
         • Duration of travel (Duration) • Destination of travel (Destination) 
         • Amount of sales of travel insurance policies (Net.Sales) 
         • Commission received for travel insurance agency (Commission) 
         • Gender of insured (Gender) • Age of insured (Age)
         
### Results
More focus of the project was on EDA rather than Model Building.
Since the Dataset was highly imbalanced dataset we have tried oversampling,undersampling,SMOTE to deal with it .
